I have tried to do the following things:
Image normalization
L2 regularization
built a gallery of 25 misclassified images within the code base


I have developed a code to download the 25 missclassfied images and stored it in a directory called Missclassified Image Gallery.The image name states the index in the test image which has been classified .For eg, missclassified_images 2129.png states that 2129 is the index in the test image that has been missclassified , that is test[2129] has been missclassified.
