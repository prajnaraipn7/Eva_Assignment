As mentioned in the class Rout=Rin+(k-1)*Jin where K is kernel size and Jin is on the base of stride

Here, we have considered 5*5 convolution in between the layers.Considering this, the receptive field is 907.

Since ,here I am not able to achieve 224,224 as RF as suggested in paper , went for 3*3 Convolutions.With this, 575 as receptive field.

And then for 1*1 Convolutions, we get 267 as receptive field.
